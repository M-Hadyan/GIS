# GIS
A client has a challenging situation with their front-end system, the system is a web-based application which allowing users to add geolocation data on a map, with the help of UI such as couple of dropdown lists that drive the users to locate their area of interests (AOI). In this task, we would like to change the strategy of getting data, which can be accomplished by developing a three ways to allow users to provide a precise location as the following: Search by address The system should allow users to type an address in order to provide the backend with search parameters. Provide National Address The system should allow users to enter their national address which will be used in the backend. UI driven, which includes Region dropdown Governorate dropdown District dropdown Parcel dropdown Street name This way should allow users to select a region first, then the governorates will be filtered based on the first selection, doing so, the map will be zoomed and navigated to the AOI.   Imagine you have a map-centric application, and you are going to add the UI elements on top of it, the UI elements must be delivered to the developers to start coding the business logic of the front-end. We suppose that you will provide a three panels to support the idea, these panels might be floating around, dockable, or fixed, but they should not overlap the map component.   The final output of this task must be delivered to the front-end developer so he/she can start coding without any need to engage the designer again in this task.
